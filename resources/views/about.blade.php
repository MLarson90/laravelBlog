<div class="container">
  <p>Lorem Ipsum is proud to have created the visual identity for the Minnesota Colorectal Cancer Research Foundation (MCCRF). The founders of MCCRF hosted an incredibly successful inaugural gala, the Semicolon Soiree, a fundraising gala to support the Minnesota Colorectal Cancer Research Foundation, which took place in early March at the Town and Country Club in St. Paul.<hr>

  Over the course of the engagement, Lorem Ipsum helped to plan the event, manage the guest list, and worked closely with the founder of MCCRF, Sandy Muschenheim, creating both identity systems and corresponding print collateral: signage, auction posters, invitations, programs, bookmarks, thank you notes and envelopes.<hr>

  The number of volunteers who came forth for this effort was considerable. We are grateful for our collaborators: Storystick Marketing, comedian Brenda Elsagher and event coordinator Stefanie Hansen.<hr>

  Thanks to the generous sponsors who made this event possible: St. Paul Radiology, Minnesota Gastroenterology, and Minneapolis Radiology.<hr>
